Abstract:


Low-energy neurofeedback (LENF) is a unique brain–computer interface (BCI) approach that delivers extremely low-intensity electromagnetic perturbations to disrupt maladaptive neural rhythms and promote self-regulation without active user effort. 
This review examines LENF mechanisms, theoretical models, and clinical findings, with particular emphasis on its integration into artificial intelligence (AI)–driven BCIs.
Evidence suggests LENF can benefit diverse conditions, including anxiety, attention deficits, and traumatic brain injury. We highlight how AI enhances neurofeedback by improving signal quality, detecting individualized biomarkers, and dynamically adapting stimulation protocols. 
Engineering frameworks for AI-modulated BCIs—encompassing real-time signal processing, multimodal integration, and wearable hardware—are reviewed alongside opportunities and challenges in safety, data requirements, and clinical trust. While rigorous trials remain limited, the convergence of 
LENF and AI points toward precision neurofeedback systems capable of co-adapting with users, offering scalable, personalized, and non-pharmacological interventions for cognitive enhancement and
